TITLE="An Android Application Sandbox System for Suspicious Software Detection",
BOOKTITLE="5th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (Malware
2010)",

ISBN={ISBN 978-1-4244-9353-1},
KEYWORDS="sandbox, malware, smartphones, system calls, static analysis, dynamic

YEAR=2010,
ABSTRACT="Smartphones are steadily gaining popularity, creating new application areas
as their capabilities increase in terms of computational power, sensors and
communication. Emerging new features of mobile devices give opportunity to
new threats. Android is one of the newer operating systems targeting
smartphones. While being based on a Linux kernel, Android has unique
properties and specific limitations due to its mobile nature. This makes it
harder to detect and react upon malware attacks if using conventional
techniques.

In this paper, we propose an Android Application Sandbox (AASandbox) which
is able to perform both static and dynamic analysis on Android programs to
automatically detect suspicious applications. Static analysis scans the
software for malicious patterns without installing it. Dynamic analysis
executes the application in a fully isolated environment, i.e. sandbox,
which intervenes and logs low-level interactions with the system for
further analysis. Both the sandbox and the detection algorithms can be
deployed in the cloud, providing a fast and distributed detection of
suspicious software in a mobile software store akin to Google's Android
Market. Additionally, AASandbox might be used to improve the efficiency of
classical anti-virus applications available for the Android operating
system."

ABSTRACT="Smartphones are getting increasingly popular and several malwares appeared
targeting these devices. General countermeasures to smartphone malwares are
currently limited to signature-based antivirus scanners which efficiently
detect known malwares, but they have serious shortcomings with new and
unknown malwares creating a window of opportunity for attackers. As
smartphones become host for sensitive data and applications, extended
malware detection mechanisms are necessary complying with the resource
constraints.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we perform static
analysis on the executables to extract their function calls in Android
environment using the command readelf. Function call lists are compared
with malware executables for classifying them with PART, Prism, and Nearest
Neighbor Algorithms. Second, we present a collaborative malware detection
approach to extend these results. Corresponding simulation results are
presented."
